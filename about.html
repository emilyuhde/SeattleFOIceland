	<h1>About Us</h1>
	
	<div class="just">
	The mission of Seattle Friends of Iceland | &#xCD;slandsvinir
	is to create a social network of people interested in discovering, discussing,
	celebrating, and promoting Icelandic arts and culture and to build social, 
	cultural, and economic relationships with peers in Iceland.
	<br/><br/>
	Seattle Friends of Iceland is a group of people in the Seattle area who
	share a love for Iceland and Icelandic culture. Our main goal is to build a
	stronger connection between Seattle and Iceland. We get together to discuss
	books, films, art, current events in Iceland, and to share food, attend lectures, 
	practice our Icelandic (English is ok too!), and discuss our travels to 
	Iceland. 
	<br/><br/>
	We meet as a group about once per month for an official meeting, but we also have
	many smaller special interest groups that meet on their own schedules to participate
	in activities they enjoy. These groups include:
